# Bubba's House

Liam's favorite place in the whole wide world was Bubba's house.

Not because of the playroom full of toys.

Not because of the big backyard and neighborhood horses.

Not even because of the snack bowls piled high with gummy worms and chocolate.

It was because of Bubba.

---

Bubba always had ideas.

"Liam," she'd say, her eyes twinkling. "I've got an idea."

And Liam would feel a little excited and a little nervous, all at the same time.

Because Bubba's ideas were always an adventure.

---

One day in the playroom, Liam found a monster figurine with sharp teeth and angry eyes.

"I don't like that one," Liam said quietly. "He's too scary."

Bubba picked up the monster. She looked at it very seriously.

Then she made it speak in a squeaky, wobbly voice: "Oh nooo! I'm so scaaary! Please don't tickle meee!"

Liam giggled.

"Again!" he said.

And suddenly, the monster wasn't so scary at all.

---

Another day, Bubba built an obstacle course in the gym.

Pillows to hop across. Pool noodles to duck under. And at the end—a big jump from one cushion to another.

Liam made it through the pillows. He wiggled under the noodles.

But the jump...

He stood at the edge. It looked so far.

"I can't do it," he said.

---

Bubba sat down next to him.

"You know what?" she said. "You don't have to. Not today."

Liam looked up at her.

"Today, we'll practice getting close," Bubba said. "And one day, when your legs are ready and your heart is ready, you'll fly right across."

So Liam practiced getting close.

And that felt like enough.

---

On his way to the kitchen, Liam passed the living room.

Pop and Pappy sat in their armchairs, watching a football game.

"Pop! Pappy! Want to do the obstacle course with me?"

Pop looked at Pappy. Pappy looked at Pop.

"I think my obstacle course days are behind me, buddy," Pop said with a wink. "But I'll time you with my phone. How's that?"

"Deal!" said Liam, and he zoomed off.

---

Later, Bubba took Liam's hand.

"Ready to feed the horses?"

Liam's tummy flip-flopped.

The horses were big. Really big. With giant teeth for chomping apples—and maybe, Liam worried, for chomping fingers too.

They walked across the yard. The horse named Butterscotch came to the fence, sniffing for treats.

Liam held the apple, but his hand wouldn't move.

---

Then he had an idea.

He looked at Butterscotch's big nostrils and long face.

And in his mind, he gave the horse a silly, squeaky voice.

"Ohhh, an apple! How delightful! I promise I'm veeery gentle!"

Liam smiled.

He held out his hand.

Butterscotch's soft lips scooped up the apple, gentle as anything.

"I did it," Liam whispered.

Bubba squeezed his shoulder. "You sure did."

---

When they came back inside, Bubba made a snack bowl.

Gummy worms. Chocolate kisses. Cookies shaped like stars.

Liam climbed onto the couch and tucked himself right into Bubba's side.

The movie started, but Liam wasn't really watching.

He was thinking about monsters that weren't so scary.

And jumps he'd make one day.

And horses that spoke in silly voices.

---

Liam looked up at Bubba.

"I love you, Bubba," he said. "Your house is my favorite place in the whole wide world."

Bubba smiled and kissed the top of his head.

"I love you too, my Liam," she said.

And Liam felt brave and warm and completely, perfectly safe.
