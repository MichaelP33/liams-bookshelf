# The Gaga Way

**A story about Liam and his wonderful Gaga**

## Gaga Arrives!

Ding-dong! The doorbell rang and Liam jumped up from his toys.

He knew that sound. He knew who was coming!

Liam ran to the door as fast as his feet could carry him. And there she was—Gaga! She walked in with her arms full of colorful bottles of Gaga juice and a bag of special Gaga snacks.

"Gaga!" Liam shouted, wrapping his arms around her in the biggest hug.

Gaga always came ready for fun. That's just the Gaga way.

## Dance Party!

"Gaga, watch this!" Liam pressed play on his favorite minion songs.

The music filled the room. Boom-boom-boom went the beat!

Liam started dancing with his silliest moves—wiggling his arms like noodles and spinning in circles.

And guess what? Gaga danced right along with him! She shimmied. She shook. She did the funniest moves Liam had ever seen.

They laughed and laughed until their tummies hurt.

"That's how Gaga dances," she said with a wink. "The Gaga way!"

## Liam's Recruits

Mom and Dad were going out for dinner, which meant Gaga and Pap Pap were in charge!

Liam had a plan.

"Gaga, Pap Pap—come sit with me!" He patted the couch cushions on both sides.

He picked his favorite show. He picked his favorite games. And one by one, he recruited them both to join in.

Could Gaga and Pap Pap say no? Of course not! They loved spending every minute with Liam.

That's the Gaga (and Pap Pap) way!

## Dinner Out

At the restaurant, Liam sat next to Gaga. The waiter brought their food, and Liam's eyes grew wide.

Gaga had fries. Golden, crispy, delicious fries.

Liam looked at his plate. Then he looked at Gaga's fries. Then back at his plate.

Gaga smiled and pushed her plate closer. "Help yourself, buddy."

And at the end of dinner? A special treat, of course.

Sharing and treats—that's the Gaga way.

## Adventure Prep

Now it was Liam's turn to visit Pittsburgh—Gaga's city!

Gaga was getting everything ready for their big adventure. She packed special snacks in her bag. She checked that everyone had their jackets.

"Are we going somewhere fun?" Liam asked, bouncing on his toes.

Gaga nodded with a twinkle in her eye. "We're going to ride the Incline!"

Liam didn't know what an Incline was, but if Gaga was excited, he was excited too!

## The Incline Adventure

The Incline was like a little train car that went up, up, up the side of a big hill!

Liam pressed his nose against the window as they climbed higher and higher.

"Look, Gaga! Tiny cars!" he pointed.

"Look! Tiny people!"

At the very top, they stepped out and looked at the whole city spread out below them. Buildings sparkled. Rivers flowed. Bridges stretched across the water.

Liam held Gaga's hand tight. This was the best adventure ever.

Gaga makes everything an adventure. That's the Gaga way.

## Thoughtful Gaga

Here's something special about Gaga: she always thinks of everyone.

When she visits Maryland, she brings Pap Pap's favorite soda. She brings Gaga juice for Dad and Liam. She even brings nail files for Mom!

And when Liam visits Pittsburgh, there are always special things waiting just for him.

Gaga remembers what everyone loves. She pays attention. She cares.

Thinking of others—that's the Gaga way.

## The Gaga Way

At the end of every visit, Liam gives Gaga the biggest hug.

He knows how lucky he is.

Lucky to have a Gaga who dances silly dances. A Gaga who shares her fries. A Gaga who turns everything into an adventure.

A Gaga who always thinks of others.

A Gaga who makes everything more fun, more special, and more full of love.

That's the Gaga way.
